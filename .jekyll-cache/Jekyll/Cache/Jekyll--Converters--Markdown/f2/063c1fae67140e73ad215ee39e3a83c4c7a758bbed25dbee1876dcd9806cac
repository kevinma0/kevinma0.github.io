I"¦<p>I joined Canary as the sole product designer in Fall 2018. Initially I was responsible for improving the mobile user experience. Due to the small size of the team however, I ended up working on design initatives across our mobile apps, web app, e-commerce experience, marketing website, advertisements, and email.</p>

<p>Here is whatâ€™s been keeping me busy.</p>

<h3 id="ï¸-the-canary-design-system">âš›ï¸ The Canary Design System</h3>

<p>With Marc DeBartolomeis, our brand designer, I built a pattern library to establish a shared understanding of our UI between design and engineering, to cut down on the time it took to design, as well as keep track of every experience within the mobile app.</p>

<!-- The project was a stunted effort the first time I tried to get it off the ground. Lesson learned: if people aren't involved from the beginning, they won't use it. -->

<p>Our web store has always driven a substantial percentage of total Canary device sales, but at the end of 2018 it was lagging far behind expectations.</p>

<p>With a product manager, I examined the performance of every part of our conversion funnel, looking for possible usability problems. We narrowed down on specific areas closer to the end of the funnel, and committed to testing small variations in controlled settings.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> We used a version that tested best for rentention. The product details page we designed resulted in a decrease in shopping cart drop off from 83% to 74% -&gt; meaning a half percent increase in total conversions. This seems insignificant, but even a single percent is huge for us.</p>

<h3 id="-marketing-site">ğŸ  Marketing Site</h3>

<p>At Canary our primary business objective is to sell an experience: peace of mind. Canary has a hardware product, but most of the time the experience happens when the user is out. This idea weaves into every aspect of design but itâ€™s the most explicit in our marketing. I worked with Marc DeBartolomeis to bring year-round campaigns from concept to execution.</p>

<h3 id="ï¸-web-onboarding">ğŸ›³ï¸ Web Onboarding</h3>

<p>We were faced with an ultimatum from Apple at the end of 2018: remove our sign ups from the app or be removed from the App Store.</p>

<p>The problem was that our sign-up included a payment step, which is no longer allowed in iOS apps.</p>

<p>This was a significant risk to our business. A large number of our subscribers come from the free trial that is offered to users during sign ups.</p>

<p>As a team we decided the best short term solution would be to port the first half of the sign up experience to webâ€¦and tell users to complete the second half on mobile.</p>

<p>Our app suffers from an outdated design that did not evolve</p>

<h3 id="-culture-of-user-testing">ğŸ™Œ Culture of User Testing</h3>

<p>This sounds cheesy, but Iâ€™m quite proud of this, more so than most tangible projects Iâ€™ve worked on.</p>

<p>I noticed that we would talk a lot as a company about â€œuser testingâ€, myself included. â€œOh, weâ€™ll test itâ€ was a common refrain.</p>
